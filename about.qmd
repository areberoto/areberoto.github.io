# About me

Hey there! I'm Alberto, an electronics engineer working with AI/ML and programming for embedded systems. I'm currently located in the beautiful country of Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½.

I love metal music ðŸ¤˜, f1 races, motorbikes, to exercise at the gym, take photos and learn about technology, specially about AI/ML.

# Writing

I post in this personal blog as a way to stay in touch with myself. I find it motivating to capture a bit of my life here and share with others part of what I do and what I have learned. Mainly I will post about AI/ML and software development for embedded systems. Occasionally I may write about personal experiences, hobbies, books I've read, photos I've taken or whatever I feel like writing about.
